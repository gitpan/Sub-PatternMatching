Sub::PatternMatching
====================

Sub::PatternMatching implements "Pattern Matching," a programming idiom
often found in functional languages like Haskell or OCaml. Pattern
Matching refers to functions that do different things for different
arguments. It is often referred to as polymorphism as well.

The syntax is currently a bit convoluted taking away much from the
benefit of readability by replacing nested if-else constructs with
pattern matching. This is supposed to be fixed in a later release, but
maintaining backward-compatibility.
